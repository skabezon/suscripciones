# A serverless guestbook web application and API built with Cloud Functions

The application is a simple guestbook website where users can post messages. It demonstrates how to build a serverless web application where static content is hosted in a storage bucket (here it uses GitHub Pages) and the backend is implemented with Cloud Functions. API Gateway is used to expose the Cloud Functions for the web user interface.
